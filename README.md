This report provides a comprehensive analysis of toy sales in Mexico. In our dashboard, I have visualized the sales and profitability performance of various toy types sold, categorized by stores, product types, and locations (e.g., "SALES BY STORE LOCATION" and "PROFIT BY PRODUCT" charts), through different visualizations (column, line, and combo charts, KPI cards).

Specifically, I used a line and stacked column chart (the "SALES VS PROFIT OVER TIME" chart) to display the profit generated from sales over specific time periods. To easily identify what was sold and how much was sold in which time frame and quarter, I created a separate date table (created using the CALENDAR function) in Power BI. This approach allows for much more convenient and straightforward application of date filtering and time-based analyses, utilizing functions like MONTH and YEAR.

In this dashboard project, I utilized Power BI's DAX functions (e.g., SUM, CALCULATE) and time intelligence capabilities. I developed the project using Power BI Desktop and leveraged the Power BI Service for publishing, sharing, and report management.

The objective of my project was to thoroughly examine sales and profitability trends in the Mexican toy market, identify performance differences by store and product, thereby supporting the determination of business strategies and operational decision-making.

As a result of this project, I effectively utilized the purpose of the defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs: Total Sales, Total Cost, Units Sold, Total Profit) and created a clear, interactive report that supports data-driven decisions. Through this dashboard, we can easily monitor sales and profit performance, and quickly identify potential problem areas or growth opportunities.
